# Memory Managment

## Description:

This project involves simulating the MVT (Multiprogramming with a Variable number of Tasks) memory management technique used in IBM machines.
MVT dynamically allocates memory to processes based on their needs, managing both the ready and job queues to ensure efficient memory utilization and process execution using FCFS(First Come First Serve).

### Memory Management Simulation:

- Memory Size: 2048 MB

- OS allocated: 512 MB

- Compaction: When the number of holes in memory exceeds 3, a compaction (defragmentation) process must be performed. This reallocation creates a single large hole at the high memory end.
